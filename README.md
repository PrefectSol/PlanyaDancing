Dancing girl on your console.

DOES NOT WORK ON PHONES!
The picture jumps only for the first ~10 seconds (until the slider goes completely down)
After that, the picture will become smooth
This is due to the fact that the set of elements in Frames.cs is of different sizes
P.S. yes, i'm too lazy to fix it.

In Frames.cs there is a set of images that is moved to Program.cs
